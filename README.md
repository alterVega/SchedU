SchedU is a revolutionary Timetable scheduling app which leverages **data analytics** and **machine learning**, with a touch of **designer tools** to grant users 100% autonomy in personalising their schedule in whatever way they want, just like an artist given a blank canvas! Features like the *weekly workload projector* which is derived from past trends, *work-time tracker*, and an *automatic smart re-scheduler* will leverage data tools to give users incredible insights into their pattern of work.
